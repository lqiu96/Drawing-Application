# Drawing-Application by Lawrence (lqiu96) and Nate (npunnavit)

A simple Java Swing GUI which allows the user to draw on a panel. Users are able to draw many shapes on the panel: rectangles, lines, arcs, and ovals. Also supports free form mode for the user to draw to their liking. Text is supported as well.

Added support for gradients, colors, and dashes. Users are able to choose the size of their line and dash length. There is now an eraser option so users are able to erase anything they drew on the panel. 

Appication also supports functionality for redo, undo, and clearing the panel.

Additionally, you can upload an image in the format (png, jpg). You can choose to detect the face using OpenCV's facial detection library.
